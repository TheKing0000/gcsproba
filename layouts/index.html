              Global Cloud Services Visibility Suite brings together a wide
              variety of GCS services/tools that are mature and follow CI/CD
              practices, making them a strong competitor to any 3rd party
              solutions we might purchase, with the added benefit that each tool
              was built with SAP in mind. The services/tools are also designed
              to be integrated with each other, essentially resulting in a
              unified and cooperative tool set.
