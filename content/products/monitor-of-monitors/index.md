<h1 class="text-center my-5">Monitor of Monitors</h1>
<p class="fs-4 ">In Global Cloud Services (GCS), multiple infrastructure stacks and layers are monitored. The One Service Desk team used to monitor 20-30 screens of different tools while trying to do live correlation just by seeing alerts on different user interfaces of different tools. </p>
<p class="fs-4">The Monitor of Monitors (MoM) is a GCS project, started in 2020.Q1, thatâ€™s meant to deliver a single pane of glass for all GCS infrastructure alerts, and enable visibility and transparency for the internal GCS and LoB teams to perform root cause analysis and make alerts actionable during bridge calls. MoM brings together alerts from compute, network, storage into a single view, with an easy-to-use dashboard experience.</p>
